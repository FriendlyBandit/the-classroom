# the-classroom
A mono-repo that tracks technologies that I would like to try, and the basic projects that I make with these technologies

Current Interests:
- Sveltekit
- picocss (bulma is my goto right now)
- Motion Canvas <- REALLY excited about this one. Need to learn TS for it though
- Hugo
- Manim (if Motion Canvas doesn't work out)
